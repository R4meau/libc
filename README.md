### What is libft?
[Libft][1] is an individual project at [42][2] that requires us to re-create some standard C library functions including some additional ones that can be used later to build a library of useful functions for the rest of the cursus.

Disclaimer: *Reinventing the wheel is bad, 42 makes us do this just so we can have a deeper understanding of data structures and basic algorithms. At 42 we're not allowed to use some standard libraries on our projects, so we have to keep growing this library with our own functions as we go farther in the cursus.*

### What's in it?

As you can see from the [Project instructions][1], there are 4 sections:

1.  **Libc Functions:** Some of the standard C functions
2.  **Additional functions:** Functions 42 deems will be useful for later projects
3.  **Bonus Functions:** Functions 42 deems will be useful for linked list manipulation
4.  **Personal Functions:** Functions I believe will be useful later

Libc functions | Additional functions | Bonus Functions | Personal Functions

Notes:

- All the files and functions are namespaced with an **ft** in front. (It stands for Fourty Two)
- The project instructions require that we put all the source files in the root directory but for the sake of this Github repo, I separate them into sub folders.

My code is not the best, but it passed all the 42 tests successfully.

### How does it work?

The goal is to create a library called libft.a from the source files so I can later use that library from other projects at 42.

To create that library, after downloading/cloning this project, **cd** into the project, copy all the files from the sub folders to the root directory and finally, call make:

	git clone https://github.com/R4meau/libft
	cd libft
	make copy
	make

You should see a *libft.a* file and some object files (.o).


Now to clean up (removing the .o files and the .c files from the root), call `make clean`

### How do I use the library?

I added an example file called **example.c**, it's using the function **ft_putstr** to print "DON'T PANIC" to the screen. 

If you try to compile it with gcc using `gcc example.c` you will get an *undefined symbol* error for ft_putstr. 

You have to tell the file where your library resides and which library it is using:

`gcc -L. -lft example.c`

-L takes the path to your library. `.` in this case<br>
-l takes the name of your library. This is the set of characters that come after `lib` in your library name.

That's it. Now run it using `./a.out`

### How do I test it? How do I test my own implementations?

To test the code we're going to be using @alelievr's [Libft Unit Test][4]. There are [some][5] [good][6] [others][7] but I'll only be covering this one.

#### 1. To test the code in this repo

1. Clone this repo and cd into it, make sure it's called `libft`:
		
		git clone https://github.com/R4meau/libft
		cd libft/
2. Copy all the source files to the root directory:
	
		make copy
3. Run Make so you can build the library:
		
		make
4. Go back to the root directory and download @alelievr's Libft Unit Test:
		
		cd ..
		git clone https://github.com/alelievr/libft-unit-test
5. Go into the test folder and run the test:

		cd libft-unit-test/
		make f

If you did everything correctly you should get a cool list of tests showing you the function name and if it passed for each test.

#### 2. To test your own code

You might want to have a go at this project too. If you never heard of Makefiles, don't worry, you don't have to learn about it now. So go ahead and follow those steps:

1. Create a directory for your project, make sure you call it `libft`:

		mkdir libft
2. Clone this repo (don't name it libft) and copy the Makefile-sample as Makefile and libft.h to your own project:

		git clone https://github.com/R4meau/libft r4-libft
		cp r4-libft/Makefile-sample libft/Makefile
		cp r4-libft/libft.h libft/
3. Go to your project, [read the instructions][1] for the function you want to create, code it and uncomment it from the Makefile:

		cd libft
		vim ft_memset.c
		vim Makefile
		
	As an example, after creating ft_memset as your first function, you go into the Makefile, remove the `#` in front of `FILES`, remove the `\` at the end of `ft_memset` and add a `#` in front of `ft_bzero`. 
	
	If it still looks complicated, **DON'T PANIC**, [just ask me][8] :)
4. Run Make so you can build the library:
		
		make	
5. Go back to the root directory and download @alelievr's Libft Unit Test:
		
		cd ..
		git clone https://github.com/alelievr/libft-unit-test
6. Go into the test folder and run the test:

		cd libft-unit-test/
		make f

That's it! If you're having some problems, just [send me a tweet][8]. If you think your problem is due to my code or this README, [create a new issue][9]. I'll definitely check it out.

Enjoy.
